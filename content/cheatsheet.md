#Shell
sudo !! - re-run previous command with 'sudo' prepended
ctrl-k, ctrl-u, ctrl-w, ctrl-y - cutting and pasting text in the command line
practical kill/yank example
use 'less +F' to view logfiles, instead of 'tail' (ctrl-c, shift-f, q to quit)
ctrl-x-e - continue editing your current shell line in a text editor (uses $EDITOR)
alt-. - paste previous command's argument (useful for running multiple commands on the same resource)
reset - resets/unborks your terminal
